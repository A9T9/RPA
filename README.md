# 📌 Questions? Suggestions? - Meet us in the Kantu user forum at https://forum.a9t9.com

Please post all questions and suggestions in our public user forum at https://forum.a9t9.com - the Kantu [selenium ide forum](https://forum.a9t9.com/c/kantu) is monitored by active users, tech support and the Kantu developers, so we would like to concentrate the discussion "over there".

Every user benefits from the questions and answers provided in the forum, that is why we would ask you to post the question [in the forum](https://forum.a9t9.com) first if a public forum is appropriate for your question.


# Are you interested in becoming a Kantu beta tester?

As beta tester, we will email you (hidden) install links for new Kantu versions before they go live in the Chrome store. **Beta versions never overwrite a regular Kantu version**. The beta channel is technically a separate extension with its own toolbar icon. So beta-testing Kantu does not interfere with your regular Kantu projects and macros. We will notify you by email once a new version is available so you can grab it.

# Building the Chrome Extension

We use Node V8.11.1 and NPM V5.6.0.

You can [install Kantu directly from the Chrome or Firefox stores](https://a9t9.com/kantu/), which is the easiest and the recommended way of using the Kantu Selenium IDE. But of course developers can also build it directly from the source code with this command line:

```
npm i
npm run build (or build_ff for Firefox)
```

Once done, the ready-to-use extension code appears in the /dist directory (Chrome) or /dist_ff directory (Firefox).
