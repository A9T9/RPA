# Building the Chrome, Edge and Firefox Extension

Building the extension is _not_ required if you "only" want to use it.

You can [install UI.Vision RPA directly from the Chrome, Edge or Firefox stores](https://ui.vision/rpa), which is the easiest and the recommended way of using the Ui.Vision RPA software. Older versions can be found in the [RPA software](https://ui.vision/rpa/archive) archive. 

The information below is only required and intended for developers:

The project uses Node V20.11.1 and NPM V10.2.4

If you have any questions, please contact us at TEAM@UI.VISION - Thanks!

# To build the extension bundle

```bash
npm i -f

npm run build   	
npm run build-ff 	
```

And the build files are in `dist` and `dist_ff` folders.

# To develop
```bash
npm i -f

npm run ext
```

The built files during development are also in `dist` and `dist_ff` folders

Once done, the ready-to-use extension code appears in the /dist directory (Chrome) or /dist_ff directory (Firefox).
